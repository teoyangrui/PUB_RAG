PUBâ€™s Code of Practice is an important reference document for engineering companies 
to build compliant and safe utility infrastructure. It consists of a few lengthy 
documents that can be difficult to navigate and read as there are frequent references 
to appendixes or drawings. The main project scope will be to build a question and answer bot 
that can provide answers by referencing the relevant parts of the lengthy documents.
